This is a collection of Lore-Friendly emergency vehicle packs gathered from different sources, such as GTA 5 Mods and LSPDFR. My goal was to fix or recreate the liveries that weren’t completely Lore-Friendly, repair the broken siren light IDs, and optimize the pack so that all vehicles are in the same folder and there’s no unnecessary code.

If anyone fixes it, please let me know on my Discord (miguexel_63), because I'd like to know.
